# This is an alfaAesar python path file. It's used by virtualenv to add your own python path
# to your virtual environment.
# Why do you need this?
# Answer: Because there are many small python programs to do things like migrate
# tables and so on. They may need to be executed within your virtual environment when setting things up.

# What do you do?
# Answer: Just add your whole path name to the project environment below this text and remove the live
# one which is pointing to MY personal directory structure.

#/home/nherriot/workspace/alfaAesar/alfacms/trunk/alfacms/alfacms

/home/nherriot/virtalenv/oauth2/django-oauth2-test/oauth2server
/home/nherriot/virtalenv/oauth2/django-oauth2-test/oauth2server/proj

# Once I've created or updated this file where do I save it?
# Answer: If you have a home dir called /home/me and your virtual environment is setup as alfaAear you
# should put your file in direcotry:
# /home/me/alfaAesar/lib/python2.7/site-packages/alfaAeasar.pth

# How can I check that this worked?
# Answer: Acitvate your virtual environment and look at your path variable from the python interprator like:
# >>> import pprint, sys
# >>> pprint.pprint(sys.path)
#
# You will see a list of directories and your new one should be there too! :-)
